### **Why a Portfolio is Helpful**

1. **Demonstrates Expertise**:
    
    - A portfolio gives tangible proof of your **technical skills** and **cybersecurity experience**, beyond what’s written on your resume.
    - It shows US companies you’re capable of applying your skills in real-world scenarios.
2. **Sets You Apart**:
    
    - Not many candidates (even natives) have portfolios. A strong portfolio will help you stand out, especially since you're competing in a global market.
3. **Addresses Language/Communication Gaps**:
    
    - If you're not a native English speaker, your portfolio lets your **work speak for itself**, reducing the emphasis on verbal skills during the initial evaluation.
4. **Establishes Credibility**:
    
    - US employers value self-starters. Building a portfolio shows initiative, dedication, and the ability to **execute independently**.

    - Kubernetes security (e.g., implementing network policies or securing pod configurations).
    - Automated vulnerability management.
- **Showcase**:
    - CI/CD pipeline diagrams.
    - Links to sample code or configurations.

#### 4. **Incident Response Playbooks**

- Examples:
    - Detailed playbooks for responding to threats like malware infections, insider threats, or account compromise.
- **Showcase**:
    - Provide redacted or anonymized versions of your playbooks.
    - Highlight how they align with frameworks like **NIST CSF** or **MITRE ATT&CK**.

#### 5. **Open-Source Contributions**
